# Scheduling Demo - React based client

Scheduling Demo is a small take-home assignment with simple UI built in React. It features basic scheduling logic.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run this to install dependencies:

```javascript
cd client

npm install
```

## Usage

Voila, you're ready to go! Just run this from the root:

```javascript
npm run start
```

Your client app will run on the http://localhost:3000 (or some other port if this is taken). From there you can start playing with the app :)

Happy using experience!

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. And after all, this is a take-home assignment project, not a world breaking tool buy hey, I am here to accept any input :)

Please make sure to update any tests as appropriate (and to add new ones)
